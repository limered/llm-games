The '''Eiffel Tower''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|f|əl}} {{respell|EYE|fəl}}; {{lang-fr|links=yes|Tour Eiffel}} {{IPA-fr|tuʁ ɛfɛl||Tour Eiffel Pronunciation.ogg}})<!--Note: French does not have tonic accents, so do not add stress marks to this pronunciation--> is a [[wrought-iron]] [[lattice tower]] on the [[Champ de Mars]] in [[Paris]], France. It is named after the engineer [[Gustave Eiffel]], whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.

Locally nicknamed "''La dame de fer''" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 World's Fair]], and to crown the centennial anniversary of the [[French Revolution]]. Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global [[cultural icon]] of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.<ref name=Key_figures>{{cite web |url=http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/the-eiffel-tower-at-a-glance.html |title=The Eiffel Tower at a glance |author=SETE |website=Official Eiffel Tower website |access-date=15 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414130600/http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/the-eiffel-tower-at-a-glance.html |archive-date=14 April 2016 }}</ref>  The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.<ref>Tourism Statistics, "Visit Paris Region" site of the Paris Ile de France Visitors Bureau, retrieved March 22, 2022.</ref> The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:<ref name=":0" /> 6.91&nbsp;million people ascended it in 2015.

During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the [[Washington Monument]] to become the [[List of tallest freestanding structures in the world#Timeline of world's tallest freestanding structures|tallest human-made structure]] in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the [[Chrysler Building]] in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting [[Aerial (radio)|aerial]] at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by {{convert|17|ft|m|order=flip}}. Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the [[List of tallest structures in France|second tallest free-standing structure in France]] after the [[Millau Viaduct]].

The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is {{convert|276|m|abbr=on}} above the ground – the highest [[observation deck]] accessible to the public in the [[European Union]]. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or [[elevator|lift]] to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift. On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use. He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as [[Thomas Edison]].

==History==
===Origin===
The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to [[Maurice Koechlin]] and [[Émile Nouguier]], two senior engineers working for the [[Gustave Eiffel|Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel]]. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Exposition Universelle]], a [[world's fair]] to celebrate the centennial of the [[French Revolution]]. In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as "a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal [[truss]]es at regular intervals".<ref>Harvie, 2006 p. 78.</ref> Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked [[Stephen Sauvestre]], the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.

[[File:Maurice koechlin pylone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|First drawing of the Eiffel Tower by Maurice Koechlin including size comparison with other Parisian landmarks such as [[Notre Dame de Paris]], the [[Île aux Cygnes#Statue of Liberty replica|Statue of Liberty]], and the [[Vendôme Column]]]]

The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nouguier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the {{lang|fr|Société des Ingénieurs Civils}}; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise {{blockquote|style=text-align:justify|text=[n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.<ref name=loyrette116>Loyrette, p. 116.</ref>}}

Little progress was made until 1886, when [[Jules Grévy]] was re-elected as president of France and [[Édouard Lockroy]] was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.<ref name=loyrette116/> (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.) On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.

After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.5&nbsp;million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.<ref>Loyrette, 1985 p. 121.</ref>

A French bank, the ''[[Crédit Industriel et Commercial]]'' (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower. During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from [[Predatory lending|predatory loans]] to the [[National Bank of Haiti]], some of which went towards the financing of the tower. These loans were connected to [[Haiti indemnity controversy|an indemnity controversy]] which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the [[Haitian Revolution]], and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, "effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income". According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country."<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|first1=Matt|last1=Apuzzo|first2=Constant|last2=Méheut|first3=Selam|last3=Gebrekidan|first4=Catherine|last4=Porter|title=How a French Bank Captured Haiti|website=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/french-banks-haiti-cic.html|date=20 May 2022|access-date=24 May 2022|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===Artists' protest===
[[File:Caricature Gustave Eiffel.png|thumb|upright|Caricature of Gustave Eiffel comparing the Eiffel tower to the [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramids]], published in ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', 14 February 1887]]

The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?searchID=91724959|title=Diagrams - SkyscraperPage.com|website=skyscraperpage.com}}</ref> and many people believed it was impossible. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a "Committee of Three Hundred" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Charles Gounod]] and [[Jules Massenet]]. A petition called "Artists against the Eiffel Tower" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, [[Adolphe Alphand]], and it was published by ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'' on 14 February 1887:

{{blockquote|style=text-align:justify|We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection{{nbsp}}... of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower{{nbsp}}... To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years{{nbsp}}... we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.<ref>Loyrette, 1985 p. 174.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ross |first1=Greg |title=Plea |url=https://www.futilitycloset.com/2021/05/18/plea-3/ |website=Futility Closet |date=18 May 2021}}</ref>}}

[[File:Guillaume Apollinaire Calligramme.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A [[calligram]] by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]]]

Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the [[Egyptian pyramids]]: "My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?"<ref name=Souriau>{{cite book|author1=Paul Souriau|author2=Manon Souriau|title=The Aesthetics of Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CzUTXhzDb8C&pg=PR7|year=1983|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0-87023-412-9|page=100}}</ref> These criticisms were also dealt with by Édouard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,<ref>Harvie, 2006 p. 99.</ref> "Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.

Indeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: "Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?"<ref>Loyrette, 1985 p. 176.</ref>

Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.<ref name=times1_4_89 >{{Cite newspaper The Times|title=The Eiffel Tower|department=News|date=1 April 1889|page=5|issue=32661|column=B|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS84463745&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0}}</ref> [[Guy de Maupassant]] supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.<ref name=Jonnes>{{cite book|author=Jill Jonnes|title=Eiffel's Tower: And the World's Fair where Buffalo Bill Beguiled Paris, the Artists Quarreled, and Thomas Edison Became a Count|url=https://archive.org/details/eiffelstowerworl00jonn|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-02060-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/eiffelstowerworl00jonn/page/163 163]–64}}</ref>

By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a [[calligram]]) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.<ref name=Greet>{{cite book|author=Guillaume Apollinaire|editor=Anne Hyde Greet|title=Calligrammes: Poems of Peace and War (1913–1916)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FviP1Cl3jcC|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01968-3|pages=411–414}}</ref> Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of [[structural art]], and is often featured in films and literature.

===Construction===
[[File:Les fondations de la Tour Eiffel, maçonneries.jpg|thumb|right|[[Foundation (engineering)|Foundations]] of the Eiffel Tower, photographed in 1887]]

Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.<ref name=origins>{{cite web |url=http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/69.html |title=Origins and construction of the Eiffel Tower |author=SETE |website=Official Eiffel Tower website |access-date=1 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731073057/http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/69.html |archive-date=31 July 2015 }}</ref> Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river [[Seine]], were more complicated: each slab needed two [[deep foundation|piles]] installed by using compressed-air [[caisson (engineering)|caisson]]s {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter driven to a depth of {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref>Loyrette, 1985 p. 123.</ref> to support the concrete slabs, which were {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of [[limestone]] with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.

Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts {{convert|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|7.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.<ref>Loyrette, 1985 p. 148.</ref> The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within {{convert|1|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} and angles worked out to one [[arcsecond|second of arc]].<ref>Eiffel, G; The Eiffel TowerPlate X</ref> The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of [[Levallois-Perret]] and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.5&nbsp;million rivets.<ref name=origins/>

At first, the legs were constructed as [[cantilever]]s, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber [[scaffold]]. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as "Eiffel Suicide!" and "Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum" appeared in the tabloid press.<ref>Harvie, 2006 p. 110.</ref> Multiple famous artists of that time, [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] and [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Alexander Dumas]], thought poorly of the newly made tower. Charles Garnier thought it was a "truly tragic street lamp". Alexander Dumas said that it was like "Odius shadow of the odious column built of rivets and iron plates extending like a black blot". There were multiple protests over the style and the reasoning of placing it in the middle of Paris.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-10-30 |title=Eiffel Tower history, architecture, design & construction |url=https://www.toureiffel.paris/en/the-monument/history |access-date=2023-11-13 |website=www.toureiffel.paris |language=en-US}}</ref> At this stage, a small "creeper" [[crane (machine)|crane]] designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.<ref name=origins/> Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments to precisely align the legs; [[hydraulic]] [[Jack (device)|jacks]] were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by [[Sand box (civil engineering)|sandboxes]] on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,<ref name=origins/> due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wonders-of-the-world.net/Eiffel-Tower/Construction-of-the-Eiffel-tower.php|work=wonders-of-the-world.net|title=Construction of the Eiffel Tower}}</ref>

===Inauguration and the 1889 exposition===
[[File:Exposition Universelle de Paris 1889 - Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Darmstadt.jpg|thumb|View of the 1889 World's Fair]]

The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.<ref name=times1_4_89 /> Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, Émile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from ''[[Le Figaro]]'' and ''[[Le Monde Illustré]]'', completed the ascent. At 2:35&nbsp;pm, Eiffel hoisted a large [[Flag of France|Tricolour]] to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.<ref>Harvie, 2006 pp. 122–23.</ref>

There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.<ref name=Exposition>{{cite web|url=http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/70.html |title=The Eiffel Tower during the 1889 Exposition Universelle |author=SETE |website=Official Eiffel Tower website |access-date=16 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425081036/http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/70.html |archive-date=25 April 2016 }}</ref>
Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,<ref>Harvie, 2006 pp. 144–45.</ref> and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.<ref name=Key_figures/>

After dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.<ref>Harriss, 1975 p. 114</ref>

[[File:Georges Garen embrasement tour Eiffel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illumination of the tower at night during the exposition; painted by {{ill|Georges Garen|fr}}, 1889]]

On the second level, the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, ''Le Figaro de la Tour'', was made.<ref>Harriss 1975, p. 115</ref>

At the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. [[Graffiti]]sts were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described the collection of responses as "truly curious".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k106381w/f335.image|page=335|title=La Tour de Trois Cents Mètres|author=Eiffel, Gustave|publisher=Lemercier|location=Paris|year=1900|language=fr|quote=On avait disposé sur certains points des parois des feuilles de papier qui étaient enlevées chaque jour, après avoir été complètement recouvertes d’inscriptions de toute nature.

Famous visitors to the tower included the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[William Cody|"Buffalo Bill" Cody]] (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and [[Thomas Edison]].<ref name=Exposition/> Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his [[phonograph]]s, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2009/05/thomas-edison-at-eiffel-tower.html|author=Jill Jonnes|publisher=Wonders and Marvels|title=Thomas Edison at the Eiffel Tower|access-date=2 January 2014|date=23 May 2009}}</ref> Edison signed the [[guestbook]] with this message: {{blockquote|style=text-align:justify|To M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.}}

Eiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the [[Paris|City of Paris]]. The city had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for many innovations in the early 20th century, particularly [[radio telegraphy]], it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the [[International Time Service]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Michelin Paris: Tourist Guide |date=1985 |publisher=Michelin Tyre Public Limited |isbn=9782060135427 |page=52 |edition=5 }}</ref>

For the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 ''Exposition Universelle'']], the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.<ref name="vogel_23-4"/> At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

In 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases.

For its "Countdown to the Year 2000" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered [[searchlight]]s were installed on the tower. During the last three minutes of the year, the lights were turned on starting from the base of the tower and continuing to the top to welcome 2000 with a huge fireworks show. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Eiffel Tower's illuminations |url=http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/the-illuminations.html |author=SETE |website=Official Eiffel Tower website |access-date=31 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822233206/http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/the-illuminations.html |archive-date=22 August 2015 }}</ref>

===Wind and weather considerations===
[[File:Lightning striking the Eiffel Tower - NOAA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Lightning striking the tower in 1902]]
When it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team – experienced bridge builders – understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them. In an interview with the newspaper ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'' published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:

{{blockquote|style=text-align:justify|Is it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony?{{nbsp}}... Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be{{nbsp}}... will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole.<ref name=debate>{{cite web|url=http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/71.html |title=Debate and controversy surrounding the Eiffel Tower |author=SETE |website=Official Eiffel Tower website |access-date=2 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908052239/http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/71.html |archive-date=8 September 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>}}

He used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically [[Exponential function|exponential]] shape.<ref name="sciencedaily2005">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050106111209.htm |title=Elegant shape of Eiffel Tower solved mathematically by University of Colorado professor |website=Science Daily |date=7 January 2005 |access-date=24 May 2010}}</ref> All parts of the tower were overdesigned to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.<ref>Watson, 1992 p. 807.</ref> In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.<ref name="sciencedaily2005"/>

===Floors===
====Ground floor====
[[File:Paris Eiffel 092.JPG|thumb|Base of the Eiffel Tower]]
The four columns of the tower each house access stairs and elevators to the first two floors, while at the south column only the elevator to the second floor restaurant is publicly accessible.

====1st floor====
[[File:Paris Exposition Eiffel Tower restaurants 2nd floor, Paris, France, 1900.jpg|thumb|Original restaurants at the 1st floor, as viewed from inside the tower]]

The first floor is publicly accessible by elevator or stairs. 
When originally built, the first level contained three restaurants – one French, one Russian and one [[Flemish Region|Flemish]] — and an "Anglo-American Bar". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. Today there is the {{lang|fr|Le 58 Tour Eiffel}} restaurant and other facilities.

[[File:La Tour Eiffel - terrasse de la première plate-forme.jpg|thumb|A promenade {{convert|2.6|m|adj=on}} wide ran around the outside of the first level]]

====2nd floor====
The second floor is publicly accessible by elevator or stairs and has a restaurant called {{lang|fr|[[Le Jules Verne]]}}, a [[gourmet]] restaurant with its own lift going up from the south column to the second level. This restaurant has one star in the [[Michelin Guide|Michelin Red Guide]]. It was run by the multi-[[Michelin star]] chef [[Alain Ducasse]] from 2007 to 2017.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dali Wiederhoft|url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/eiffel-tower-sightseeing-restaurants-links-transit/|title=Eiffel Tower: Sightseeing, restaurants, links, transit|publisher=Bonjour Paris|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040320/http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/eiffel-tower-sightseeing-restaurants-links-transit/|archive-date=6 January 2014}}</ref> As of May 2019, it is managed by three-star chef [[Frédéric Anton]].<ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/monument/tour-eiffel.htm |title=Eiffel Tower in Paris | year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |access-date=14 September 2018}}</ref> It owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer [[Jules Verne]].

====3rd floor====
The third floor is the top floor, publicly accessible by elevator.

From 1937 until 1981, there was a restaurant near the top of the tower. It was removed due to structural considerations; engineers had determined it was too heavy and was causing the tower to sag.<ref>{{cite news |last= Marcus|first= Frances Frank|date= 10 December 1986|title= New Orleans's 'Eiffel Tower'|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/10/garden/new-orleans-s-eiffel-tower.html|work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date= 22 November 2018}}</ref> This restaurant was sold to an American restaurateur and transported to New York and then New Orleans.

===Lifts===
The arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower's history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

[[File:Tour Eiffel Ascenseur Roux, Combaluzier et Lepape.jpg|thumb|The Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape lifts during construction.]]

Equipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.<ref name=vogel_20>Vogel, pp. 20–21.</ref>

Constructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.<ref name=vogel_28>Vogel, p. 28.</ref> Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around {{convert|3.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}} diameter [[sprocket]]s. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.<ref name=vogel_28/>

[[File:Eiffel-Otis lift-poyet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Otis lifts originally fitted in the north and south legs]]

Installing lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis Brothers & Company]] submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.<ref name="vogel_23-4">Vogel, pp. 23–24.</ref> Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.<ref>Harriss 1976, p. 93</ref>

The car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. [[Power (physics)|Motive power]] was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram {{convert|12.67|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|96.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of {{convert|10.83|m|ftin|abbr=on}}: this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a [[block and tackle]] but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.<ref>Harriss 1975, p. 93</ref>

The original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Léon Edoux. A pair of {{convert|81|m|ft|abbr=on}} hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car travelled only half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k106381w/f187.image|title=La Tour de Trois Cents Mètres|author=Eiffel, Gustave|year=1900|publisher=Société des imprimeries Lemercier|location=Paris|language=fr|pages=171–3}}</ref>

===Engraved names===
{{Main|List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower}}
[[File:Les savants de la Tour Eiffel.jpg|thumb|right|Names engraved on the tower]]

Gustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this "invocation of science" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986–87 by the {{lang|fr|Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel}}, a company operating the tower.<ref name="lab&names">{{cite web |author=SETE |title=The Eiffel Tower Laboratory |url=http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/88.html |website=Official Eiffel Tower website |date=2010 |access-date=25 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212232554/http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/88.html |archive-date=12 February 2017 }}</ref>

The tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky.<ref name=paintingcolor>{{cite web|title=The Eiffel Tower gets beautified|url=http://www.toureiffel.paris/images/actualites/PDF/how_the_eiffel_tower_gets_beautified.pdf|author=SETE|website=Official Eiffel Tower website|access-date=8 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121090936/http://www.toureiffel.paris/images/actualites/PDF/how_the_eiffel_tower_gets_beautified.pdf|archive-date=21 November 2015}}</ref> It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as "Eiffel Tower Brown".<ref name=painting>{{cite web |title=Painting the Eiffel Tower |url=http://www.toureiffel.paris/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/97 |author=SETE |website=Official Eiffel Tower website |access-date=25 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20161026114502/http://www.toureiffel.paris/everything-about-the-tower/themed-files/97 |archive-date=26 October 2016 }}</ref> In what is expected to be a temporary change, the tower is being painted [[Olympic gold medal|gold]] in commemoration of the upcoming [[2024 Summer Olympics]] in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oliver |first=Huw |title=The Eiffel Tower is being painted gold for the 2024 Olympics |url=https://www.timeout.com/news/the-eiffel-tower-is-getting-a-golden-makeover-ahead-of-the-2024-olympics-020821 |access-date=2022-11-30 |website=Time Out Worldwide |date=8 February 2021 |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-02-03 |title=Eiffel Tower receives €50m makeover to make it look more golden for the Olympics |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eiffel-tower-olympics-makeover-2024-paris-b1796893.html |access-date=2022-11-30 |website=The Independent |language=en}}</ref>

The only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corusconstruction.com/en/reference/teaching_resources/architectural_studio_reference/history/development_of_the_clear_span_building/exhibition_buildings/ |title=History: Development of clear span buildings – Exhibition buildings |work=Architectural Teaching Resource |publisher=Tata Steel Europe, Ltd |access-date=4 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005073648/http://www.tatasteelconstruction.com/en/reference/teaching_resources/architectural_studio_reference/history/development_of_the_clear_span_building/exhibition_buildings/ |archive-date=5 October 2013}}</ref>

===Maintenance===
Maintenance of the tower includes applying 60&nbsp;tons of paint every seven years to prevent it from [[rust]]ing. The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times<!-- as of 2024 --> since it was built, with the most recent being in 2010. [[Lead paint]] was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment.<ref name="allyouneed">{{cite web|url=http://www.eiffel-tower.com/images/PDF/about_the_Eiffel_Tower.pdf|title=All you need to know about the Eiffel Tower|author=SETE|website=Official Eiffel Tower website|access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Bavelier|first=Ariane|url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2009/03/28/03004-20090328ARTFIG00210-coup-de-pinceau-sur-la-tour-eiffel-.php|title=Coup de pinceau sur la tour Eiffel|date=3 December 2013|work=Lefigaro|access-date=28 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240524-eiffel-tower-ticket-prices-to-rise-by-20-percent|title=Eiffel Tower ticket prices to rise by 20 percent |date=24 May 2024 |work=France 24 |access-date=25 May 2024}}</ref>

==Communications==
[[File:Tour Eiffel le sommet 08-2015 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Top of the Eiffel Tower with antennas]]

The tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the [[cupola]] to anchors on the [[Avenue de Suffren]] and Champ de Mars. These were connected to [[longwave]] transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the [[Paris Observatory]], using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the [[United States Naval Observatory]], which used an aerial in [[Arlington County, Virginia]]. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite news |title=Paris time by wireless |newspaper=The New York Times |date=22 November 1913 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E2D71E3BE633A25751C2A9679D946296D6CF |page=1}}</ref> Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.

The imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the {{lang|fr| Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel}} (SNTE), Stéphane Dieu, commented in 2005: "It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve".<ref name="fastco">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/668174/eiffel-tower-repossessed|date=2 February 2005|magazine=Fast Company|title=Eiffel Tower: Repossessed|access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref> SNTE made over €1&nbsp;million from copyright fees in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3029993.stm|title=Are things looking up for the Eiffel Tower?|date=16 May 2003|access-date=16 April 2016|work=BBC News|author=James Arnold}}</ref> However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.<ref name="artjournal">{{cite web|url=https://alj.artrepreneur.com/night-photos-eiffel-tower-violate-copyright/|title=Do night photos of the Eiffel Tower violate copyright?|publisher=Artrepreneur Art Law Journal|author=Steve Schlackman|date=16 November 2014|access-date=13 July 2020}}</ref>

The copyright claim itself has never been tested in courts to date, according to a 2014 article in the ''Art Law Journal'', and there has never been an attempt to track down millions of people who have posted and shared their images of the illuminated tower on the Internet worldwide. However, the article adds that commercial uses of such images, like in a magazine, on a film poster, or on product packaging, may require prior permission.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/photographs-of-eiffel-tower-at-night/ |title=Is it Illegal to Take Photographs of the Eiffel Tower at Night? |date=13 March 2017 |last=Larsen |first=Stephanie |access-date=24 February 2021 |website=[[Snopes]]}}</ref>

French doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented,<ref>{{cite book|title=Notions Fondamentales Du Droit D'auteur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M6w3991thgsC&pg=PA277|year=2002|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|language=fr|isbn=978-92-805-1013-3|page=277|quote=La représentation d'une œuvre située dans un lieu public n'est licite que lorsqu'elle est accessoire par rapport au sujet principal représenté ou traité}}</ref> a reasoning akin to the ''[[de minimis]]'' rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.

==Replicas==

[[File:Paris hotel (Las Vegas)1.JPG|thumb|right|Replica at the [[Paris Las Vegas]] Hotel, Nevada, United States]]

As one of the most famous landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is [[Blackpool Tower]] in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town.<!--Blackpool is not a city.--> It opened in 1894 and is {{convert|158.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Blackpool Tower|url=http://www.historyextra.com/blackpool|publisher=History Extra|access-date=6 March 2014}}</ref> [[Tokyo Tower]] in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klm.com/destinations/pl/pl/article/the-red-and-white-eiffel-tower-of-tokyo|title=The red and white Eiffel Tower of Tokyo|publisher=KLM|access-date=16 April 2016}}</ref>

There are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the [[Paris Las Vegas]], Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at [[Kings Island]], located in [[Mason, Ohio]], and [[Kings Dominion]], [[Virginia]], amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in [[Durango, Durango|Durango, Mexico]] that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/28/replicas-eiffel-tower_n_3721294.html|title=The most legit Eiffel Tower replicas you didn't know existed|date=19 August 2013|publisher=Huffpost Travel|author=Todd van Luling|access-date=16 April 2016}}</ref>

In 2011, the TV show ''Pricing the Priceless'' on the [[National Geographic Channel]] speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480&nbsp;million to build.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Eiffel Tower|series=Pricing the Priceless|station=National Geographic Channel (Australia)|date=9 May 2011|season=1|number=3}}</ref> This would be more than ten times the cost of the original (nearly 8 million in 1890 Francs; ~US$40&nbsp;million in 2018 dollars).
