But we need a name... something simple, yet powerful.\" They looked up at the apple tree above them. \"How about 'Apple'?\" Martina suggested. \"An apple stands for curiosity and knowledge.

      "Day and night, they worked, supported by their friends and family who believed in their vision. Finally, after many months of hard work, the first \"Apple\" computer was ready. It was small, affordable, and so simple that truly anyone could use it.\n"
