      "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away named California, where the sun nearly always shines and dreams are big, there lived two very curious friends named Timmy and Martina. Timmy was a tinkerer. He loved playing with old radios and computers, taking them apart and putting them back together. Martina, on the other hand, was a dreamer. She loved to paint and imagined stories of how the world could be made better through technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, as they sat in the garden under a large apple tree, a apple suddenly fell right onto Timmy's head. \"Ouch!\" he exclaimed, but then they started to laugh. At that moment, Martina had a brilliant idea. \"What if we build our own computer, one that's so simple everyone can use it? One for kids, their parents, and even grandparents?\"\n"
